# Workflow for the Integration of Heritage Digital Resources


The Workflow for the Integration of Heritage Digital Resources is jointly offered by [MAP CNRS](http://map.cnrs.fr) and [FORTH-ICS](http://www.ics.forth.gr/) and it is will take place the 23/05/2017 - 14:00 @ [ITN-DCH Final Conference](http://digitalheritage2017.eu)

The aim of the workshop is to introduce the participants to the concept of linked data and to a selection of data curation tools that can be used for re-using and integrating data from across data silos, including a demonstration of how to semantically map them.
The tutorial will make use of: 

* [**OpenRefine**](http://openrefine.org) together with [Wikidata](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q5593), [Geonames](http://www.geonames.org), [AAT](http://www.getty.edu/research/tools/vocabularies/aat/) and [VIAF](http://viaf.org) for analysing, cleaning, normalise and enrich the data
* [**3M**](http://139.91.183.3/3M/) for mapping the data to CIDOC-CRM.

We are going to demonstrate the possible applications of these softwares, as well as the methodologies behind them, using diverse datasets from four museums:

* [MoMa](https://www.moma.org) - original data available [here](https://github.com/MuseumofModernArt/collection)
* [MET](http://www.metmuseum.org) - original data available [here](https://github.com/metmuseum/openaccess)
* [TATE](http://www.tate.org.uk) - original data available [here](https://github.com/tategallery/collection)
* [CMOA](http://cmoa.org) - original data available [here](https://github.com/cmoa/collection)

We specifically chose collection datasets containing information about works of art from [Picasso](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pablo_Picasso).
 
In order to have a unique working environment we set up a vagrant virtual machine with **OpenRefine**, some utilities and the file we will be used during the workshop.
[Vagrant VM available clicking here](https://github.com/ncarboni/ITNDCH_workshop/releases). For the instruction on how to use the virtual machine please refer to the [Wiki page here](https://github.com/ncarboni/ITNDCH_workshop/wiki/Virtual-Machine)

In order to use 3M it is necessary to register to the service. You can do it at this address: [**http://139.91.183.3/3M/SignUp?lang=en**](http://139.91.183.3/3M/SignUp?lang=en)

**We will keep updating the repository and the Wiki adding the slides and information on the commands and methodologies used**
