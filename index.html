      <h2>Abstract</h2>
     The main focus of the workshop is to introduce the participants to the concept of linked data and to the different data curation tools for re-use and integrating data silos (including examples from tangible and intangible heritage), as well as to illustrate how to semantify them, throughout the use of existing resources in the cultural heritage domain. A focus is going to be given to the transformation of existing resource (CSV, XML etc.) to RDF, throughout the use of data transformers/mappers or throughout the creation of virtual layers for their integration. The workshop will last the whole day and is going to promote a hands-on approach to several important tools that are daily used in the field.
    Aim of the program is to help participants familiarize with different instruments that they would allow them to re-use the data daily produced by the different communities (CH, public administration, GIS, etc.).
        At the end of day, the participants will have knowledge of how to to integrate heterogeneous  dataset together, mapping them to an existing ontology and share them throughout the use of an open license.

        The workshop is going to take place <strong>Tuesday 23 at 14:00</strong> and it is going to last for <strong>four hours</strong>. 
        It is split into two main sections.
        The first one will cover the basic cleaning and enrichment tasks, while the other is going to present mapping strategies and tool for semantify the data

    <section id="audience">
      <h2>Audience</h2>
      <!-- Who and how many people are likely to attend?
           (One paragraph) -->
      <p>
        We expect to attract people working in Cultural Heritage and Linked Data consumption,
        specifically professional from the GLAM community.
        Additionally, we expect to attract newcomers who are interested in transforming, enrich, and share their data.
        Participants are going to work with a pre-selected dataset, but they can bring their own data to further test and discuss personalise solutions for their need.
        Participants should bring their own laptop.

          George works in the domain of semantic representation of cultural heritage data using formal ontologies, particularly, <a href="http://cidoc-crm.org">CIDOC CRM</a>. He was an Experienced Researcher in the Marie Curie project ITN Digital Cultural Heritage, where he worked on the issues of semantic representation of 3 and 4 dimensional models. In collaboration with other fellows, he produced a number of publications on the issue of documenting data provenance for digital models from the digitization process through to virtual reconstructions. Presently, George works in the <a href="http://www.parthenos-project.eu">Parthenos project</a> on conceptualizing the semantic framework for a cross disciplinary research infrastructure.
